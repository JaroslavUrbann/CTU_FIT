# Overview
In the folders above, I have saved some code and other miscellaneous things that I created while studying at the Faculty of Information Technology,
Czech Technical University in Prague. This is by no means all of it.  

Below, I have listed all the courses I have taken at FIT so far. I have also included some statistics and my final grade.  
I also picked 3 courses from each semester that I enjoyed the most. This rating is very subjective.  
Below each course, I have included some observations and recommendations for any future students. Enjoy.

  Kohl칤ks' labs are by far the easiest, and he explains everything nicely, you should ask to be transfered there at the beggining of the semester.
  
  CAO is a course that seems very overwhelming while you're taking it because you won't
  understand most of what you'll hear in the lectures and labs, but you should always keep
  in mind that it has a very high passing rate and not spend too much time on it, even if
  you feel like you don't understand anything.
  
  You'll always get 2x more points then you expected and you won't even know how.

  I'd say that being fully focused during lectures and doing homework is the way to go for this course.
  
  It's not a hard course so you probably don't want to read the course textbook, but it's not trivial either,
  so you have to be focused during lectures if you want to get a good grade.
  
  You can get homework by attending Trlifajov치's lectures or going to Nollov치's labs.
  I've found that Trlifajov치's homework always helped me understand the topic a bit better.
  The final exam might be a little bit harder than you'll expect from the 2 tests during the semester, 
  so getting easy points by doing homework is also helpful to stay on the safe side.

  If you like small algorithmic challenges, then this course will be easy & fun for you. I'd recommend doing Jel칤nek's homework if you do,
  It's quite well prepared. Definitely attend Bal칤k's lectures over someone else's.

  Paying attention to every word and writing down every second word is how to get an A in this course. Lectures are very informative and condensed,
  but the slides aren't. Ku캜era is a very good & entertaining lecturer but you don't really want to watch the lectures multiple times
  in preparation for the exam (it's not that hard), so if you wan't to get a good grade, you really have to pay attention during the lectures.
  
  If you wan't to get an A however, you should also go through the slides and actually search for all the laws that the slides refer to and read
  them yourself. They are suprisingly readable and you'll find that they mention a lot of things that weren't explicitly said during the lectures,
  but exactly these things also will be in the exam.

  It's extra work but it introduces you into college mathematics and refreshes old concepts from high school.
  I wouldn't say it's important for passing future courses but it's nicely done and free :)
  
  The final exam is easier than the average quiz on Marast, so you don't really need to prepare for it that much.

  Ba콏inka is probably the best teacher in this course, so I recommend you attend his labs.
  
  I got an A by preparing for each test the night before and then in the morning directly before the test.
  The test questions are quite specific so I'd always prepare by solving questions from fit-wiki and nothing else. 
  I'd often even go over the same questions multiple times. This way, I sometimes got lucky in the actual test by getting a question that I just solved a few minutes ago in preparation.
  
  Lectures didn't seem to be that important in regards to your actual grade, although if you listened carefuly you could sometimes catch
  a tip about the upcoming tests, which was helpful. Especially the later lectures could be skipped without missing too much though.

  If you never worked with linux, it's a helpful resource. But so is a bunch of other things on the internet. 
  It probably won't hurt you if you skip this course. If you don't, then be assured that you don't have to worry about
  the final test at all, that's all Im gonna say.

  Deadliest course of the semester, I guess. I'd recommend Kalvoda for lectures and Pau코/Hrab치k/Kalvoda for labs.
  The course textbook is very nicely done. I think that a lot of people choose to watch the lectures multiple times
  instead of reading the textbook, but I don't think that's the optimal way to take this course.
  
  Don't forget to get enough practice in solving problems, you won't really need much theory until the final exam.
  It's also good to know that about 50% of people pass through the written part of the exam and 90% of them pass through
  the oral exam, so you don't really need to worry about passing the oral exam.

  I'd recommend keeping an eye on interesting lectures that might pop up in this course, but it probably doesn't make much sense
  to attend all of them, if they don't seem interesting to you.
  
  Also, if you're going to attend a lecture,
  make sure to ask questions, otherwise, you could have just watched the recording at higher speed and saved time.

  I'd say you probably want Hunka or Matou코ek for labs.
  
  If you want a good grade, then you just have to learn SQL and relational algebra a little bit sooner then others.
  Then for the final exam, you also need a little bit of theory, but it's quite trivial.
  
  If you're into software engineering, then you'll probably enjoy this course the most.

  LIN has an abundance of materials you can study from. I'd recommend reading the course textbook throughout the semester and watch the youtube videos by
  Dombek & Kleprl칤k to refresh your memory during the exam period instead of watching all of the lectures again with higher speed.
  
  Also beware of making small mistakes when solving long calculus problems, they can cost you a lot since there isn't many of these problems in the
  final exam and each of them is worth a lot of points.

  Surynek gives out a lot of free points, however it's quite an easy course and 13% is quite deceptive since a lot of people choose not to take
  the optional oral exam that is required for higher grades. Therefore I would recommend LSJs' labs, she clearly cares about the course and she'll actively
  encourage you to answer her questions and be an active part of the lab.
  
  The semestral work is much easier than the average semestral work in other subjects.
